// An on-demand price benchmark for an EXISTING quote (Master Admin only, see
// estimateQuotePriceAction in app/(staff)/quotes/actions.ts) — a read-only
// sanity check against whatever price was actually charged, using the exact
// same pricing brain (lib/aiAutoQuote.ts's estimatePricing) that actually
// prices and sends a quote unattended. These used to be two separately-
// prompted AI calls that reasoned completely differently — this one asked
// for a flat "market rate per km", which drifts toward taxi-tier numbers,
// while estimatePricing asks for supplier cost then a margin on top, which
// in practice lands on far more sensible figures — and disagreed by roughly
// 3x on the same kind of trip in real testing. Rather than maintain two
// pricing philosophies that happen to agree sometimes, this now delegates
// to that one function, adding on top of it:
// 1. Every leg of the journey, not just the first — a quote's enquiry can
//    have more than one leg (a multi-stop tour, a separate return leg, ...),
//    and reading only enquiry_legs[0] silently threw the rest of the trip
//    away. Real per-leg distances are summed into one real total, and each
//    leg's own special requirements/luggage are folded in too, not just
//    leg 1's — see aggregateLegs() below.
// 2. A real driving distance from Google's Distance Matrix API
//    (lib/tripDistance.ts) for each leg, fed into the same call as
//    grounding — estimatePricing's own direct callers (the SLA sweep,
//    WhatsApp-lead and manual-assign triggers) don't pass this, so this is
//    currently the one caller that does.
// 3. This tenant's own real historical rate/km for a similarly-sized
//    vehicle (lib/quotePricingBenchmark.ts), shown alongside the model's
//    own price as context — it used to silently REPLACE the model's number
//    whenever there was enough of it to trust, which meant clicking
//    "Get AI estimate" could show a figure the model never actually
//    reasoned about. The button is specifically for seeing what the AI
//    model thinks, so the estimate shown is always estimatePricing's own
//    selling_price now; the historical rate is surfaced only as an
//    informational comparison.
