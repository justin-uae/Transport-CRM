// AI Auto-Quote (see supabase/migrations/0087_ai_auto_quote.sql and
// app/api/cron/ai-auto-quote/route.ts) — a lead that's sat unquoted for
// longer than the tenant's configured SLA (Settings -> AI Auto-Quote,
// default 24 business hours, Monday-Saturday) gets released back to the
// pool if it was assigned, and OpenAI prices and sends a real quote for it,
// exactly the way a human would from Pending Quotes -> New Quote — same
// quote_sent email, PDF, quote_events/status lifecycle. Only the pricing
// source and who clicks "send" differ.
//
// createAndSendQuote (below) is also the shared engine behind two other
// triggers that reuse this exact same pricing/build/send logic, each with
// its own tag so the lead's own Assignment history timeline (see
// LeadAssignmentHistory.tsx) can tell them apart:
// - "whatsapp_lead" — a brand-new lead captured over WhatsApp (see the
//   360dialog webhook), fired instantly at creation, tenant-gated on
//   tenants.whatsapp_auto_quote_enabled (0094_whatsapp_auto_quote.sql).
// - "manual_assign" — a Master Admin/Sales Manager explicitly assigning a
//   lead to the AI role's profile (assignLeadAction), fired instantly
//   instead of waiting for the SLA sweep to eventually pick it up.
// - "website_lead" / "email_lead" / "manual_lead" — the same instant quote
//   as "whatsapp_lead", for a brand-new lead from those sources, each on its
//   own switch (0106_instant_auto_quote_sources.sql) — see
//   instantAutoQuoteNewLead at the bottom of this file.
// All of those also try a WhatsApp send alongside the email
// (alsoSendWhatsApp) — the SLA-breach sweep path deliberately does not,
// keeping that specific trigger's behaviour exactly as it was.
